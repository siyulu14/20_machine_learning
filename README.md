# Exoplanet Exploration

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying whether a record is a candidate exoplanet from the dataset of observed objects.

In this homework assignment, you will need to:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

## Evaluation
According to the analysis, though grid search helpt to improve the precision, knn without tune got the best score (I tried to tune it, but I got an error.). None of three model got a good score. It may because I choosed the wrong column to fit the model, or I mis-scale the data. Or they are not so correlative.
